Customer Segmentation for a Retail Store

Objective:
The goal of this project is to use transaction data to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. This analysis aims to identify distinct groups of customers, enabling targeted marketing strategies, personalized promotions, and improved customer retention.

Description:
By analyzing historical sales data, we can uncover patterns and trends that help in understanding customer behavior. This project involves the following key steps:

1. *Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:* 
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing duplicates
   - Standardizing data formats
   - Feature engineering

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* 
   - Summary statistics
   - Data visualization
   - Identifying trends and patterns

3. *Clustering Algorithms (e.g., K-means):* 
   - Implementing clustering algorithms to segment customers
   - Evaluating and validating clusters

4. *Visualization of Customer Segments:* 
   - Visual representation of clusters
   - Insights derived from the segments

The dataset used for this project consists of historical sales transactions from a retail store. 

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for implementing clustering algorithms
